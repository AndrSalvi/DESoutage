Tweets collection on Digital Ecosystems Outages


In this repo, I will collecting into a few tweets on digital ecosystems outages. The idea is that of looking at users' perspectives and reactions towards the temporary disruptions of Digital Ecosystems' services.

Users expect adamant and rock-solid reliability from digital ecosystems like Google, and even more so in these fuzzy times we are living. As William Dixon puts it: "What you have is an increasingly smaller number of technology providers that are systemically important [...] If there is one issue, then the cascades of that are quite significant."
